## Stable Task Assignment for Social-Network-Assisted Collective Computing

- This project is a realization of Social-Network Assisted Stable Task Assignment for Collective Computing.
- The main idea of this method is based on influence maximization and stable matching.

### Estimation of influence of worker set

We combine the method of OPIM-C and budgeted influence maximization to give a estimation of the influence

### Stable Matching & Task assignment

We use Generalized DA as our main algorithm, and propose the new choice function of workers

We also propose a new heuristic algorithm.
