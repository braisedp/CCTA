## Social-Network Assisted Stable Task Assignment for Collective Computing

- This project is a realization of Social-Network Assisted Stable Task Assignment for Collective Computing.
- The main idea of this method is based on influence maximization and stable matching.

### Estimation of influence of worker set

For every task, the choice function runs an online algorithm with approximate ratio $\alpha$

We combine the method of OPIM-C and budgeted influence maximization

### Stable Matching & Task assignment

We use Generalized DA as our main algorithm, and propose the new choice function of workers

We also propose a new heuristic algorithm.
